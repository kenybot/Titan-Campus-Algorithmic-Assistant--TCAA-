Required Deliverables
Each student submits:

ZIP file containing all .py code and README

PPTX presentation (max 10 slides)

3. Live demonstration during class


You will walk me through your GUI

Explain your code, algorithms, and design choices

Grading Rubric (50 points)
20 pts – Functional correctness of all modules

10 pts – Code quality and structure

5 pts – Presentation

15 pts – In-class live demo performance

Timeline & Suggestions
 

You have two full weeks to complete this project.

Please start early—GUI + algorithms + testing takes time.
